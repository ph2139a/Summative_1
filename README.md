1.  **Propose a new product for your employer or a small-scale side project for your organisation**

**Project Charter**

-   **Overview** - This information technology project will focus on development of an adversarial patching application that can fool an object detection model. At upload of an image the application will generate and apply an adversarial patch that will force a misclassification of objects that appear within the patched image when it is passed to a deep learning-based convolutional neural network.

-   **Scope** - A web application will be developed that permits image upload, adversarial patch generation, patch application and image presentation. This application will output the classification results for the unpatched and patched image. The minimum viable project is a system that demonstrably completes these goals with a small set of test images. Ensuring that this system is robust enough to handle a wide variety of image inputs is out of scope for this project. 

-   **Schedule** - This project will be completed by 19th January 2024. A linear project management approach will be utilised as only one person will work on the project, the outcome is predictable and it is tightly time-bound. 

-   **Risks** - The principal risk stems from the inherent complexity of the task that the web app seeks to complete. The most straightforward approach will be taken, focussing on test driven development to ensure succinct and robust implementation.

-   **Stakeholders** - I am a key stakeholder as I am completing the project as part of a data science university course. The other key stakeholder is the university faculty that will review the assignment. 

**Deliverable List**

-   A GitHub repository containing a web application that permits image upload, adversarial patch generation, patch application and image presentation.

-   A zip file from which the application can be run

-   A PDF copy of this README file

**Task List & Schedule**

-   This project's tasks and schedule are managed via GitHub projects. 

**Risk Register**

-   At project outset the principal risk is that the application is more complex than appears to be required by the assessment brief and as a result will take longer to complete than expected. Despite this risk a minimum viable product will be developed and submitted as the product is of significant value to the organisation.
